Nearly 10,000 workers are suing Chipotle for allegedly cheating them on their pay.
Current and former Chipotle (CMG) employees claim that the company made them work extra hours "off the clock" without paying them. It's a practice known as wage theft, and Chipotle is allegedly doing it all over the United States.



Chipotle denies any wrongdoing and says the case has no merit. The company says it has paid all wages it owes employees.
